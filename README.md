# Flight Tracker
*Started September 09, 2020*

Got the idea from the Geodose [Build Your Own Flight Tracking Application with Python and Open Air Traffic Data](https://www.geodose.com/2020/08/create-flight-tracking-apps-using-python-open-data.html) post I came across. The tutorial is built using Python, and I'm going to try to do it in JavaScript.
